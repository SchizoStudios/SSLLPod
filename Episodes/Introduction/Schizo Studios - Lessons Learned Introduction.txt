Schizo Studios - Lessons Learned Introduction

00:00:00 Mikah Smith: Welcome to Schizo Studios lessons learned, the where astrology, history, psychology and whatever else suits my fancy all collide in one big swirling vortex of curiosity. I'm your host, anonymous schizophrenic, here to dig into the myths, mythological tales, hidden patterns, entangled stories that shape the way we see ourselves, and maybe the universe too. This show is powered by Houkai, my trusty one of my trusty digital co-pilots that help spin raw topics into thoughtful episodes. Whether it's a deep dive into the astrology, arithmetic files, unpacked every last myth and symbol or spontaneous detour into something completely unexpected, you can count on each episode to bring something a little different.
